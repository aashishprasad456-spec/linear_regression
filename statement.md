# 5.2 Statement

## Problem statement
- **Summary:** Predict individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and personal data (age, sex, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region) using a linear regression approach.
- **Motivation:** Health insurers, policy makers, and healthcare analysts need accurate, interpretable cost predictions to set premiums, estimate risk, and design targeted interventions. A simple, transparent linear model helps communicate drivers of cost and provides a baseline for more complex models.

## Scope of the project
- **In scope:**
  - Data ingestion from `insurance.csv` and preprocessing (cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values if any).
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to identify relationships and potential feature engineering opportunities.
  - Implementation of one or more linear regression models (simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and regularized variants like Ridge/Lasso as optional extensions).
  - Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²) and cross-validation.
  - Clear documentation, reproducible scripts/notebooks, and examples showing how to train and evaluate the model on the provided dataset.
- **Out of scope:**
  - Production deployment (full API/server) and real-time scoring pipelines are not required but can be suggested as future work.
  - Advanced non-linear models (deep learning) and large-scale distributed training are outside the current scope but may be considered later.

## Target users
- **Students and learners:** People learning supervised regression techniques and end-to-end ML workflow.
- **Data scientists / analysts:** Practitioners who need a quick, interpretable baseline for predicting insurance charges.
- **Instructors:** Educators demonstrating linear regression, EDA, and model evaluation.
- **Stakeholders in healthcare/insurance:** Non-technical stakeholders who benefit from interpretable insights into cost drivers.

## High-level features
- **Data pipeline:** Scripts/notebook to load `insurance.csv`, inspect and preprocess data, and save processed datasets.
- **Exploratory analysis:** Visualizations and summary statistics highlighting variable distributions and correlations with charges.
- **Model training:** Implementations for linear regression models and optional regularized variants.
- **Evaluation & validation:** Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²), cross-validation routines, and comparison tables.
- **Reproducibility:** Clear instructions, a `requirements.txt` (or equivalent), and sample commands to reproduce results.
- **Documentation:** A concise README and in-file comments explaining usage and extension points.

If you want, I can also add a `requirements.txt`, a short README, or implement an example notebook demonstrating training and evaluation. Which would you like next?
